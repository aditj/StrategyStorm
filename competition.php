                      Strategy Storm is a social business case competition organized by students of Consulting Club, IIT Guwahati. Graduate and undergraduate students from all over the country will gather to solve business, marketing and PR related problems for social enterprises and organizations. By organizing this competition, we seek to introduce students to real life global social business models and to communicate how all traditional business strategies can be applied to social enterprises and organizations, improve students’ strategic thinking by challenging them with marketing and management problems, and promote social business all around the world.

                    <p>
                      Strategy Storm was started only last year, when a small group of students were inspired by the developing trend and lack of quality case competition in India at undergraduate level and decided to start one at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. This is just the beginning for Strategy Storm and we plan to become one of the most prestigious undergraduate case competitions in the country. Our entire project is inspired by an amazing project called Creative Shock by students at ISM University of Management and Economics, Lithuania. One thing is for sure – Strategy Storm Case Competition faces exciting times ahead, so stay tuned.
